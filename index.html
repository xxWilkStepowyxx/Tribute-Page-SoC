            <p><b>Kenneth "Kenny" McCormick</b> is one of the four main characters in the adult animated television series South Park along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman. His often muffled and incomprehensible speech – the result of his parka hood covering his mouth – is provided by co-creator Matt Stone. He debuted on television when South Park first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in The Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Stone and long-time collaborator Trey Parker in 1992 (Jesus vs. Frosty) and 1995 (Jesus vs. Santa).</p>

            <p>Kenny is a third, later fourth-grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his hometown of South Park, Colorado, where he lives with his poverty-stricken family.
            <p>

            <p>He has gained a lot of popularity thanks to a running gag most prevalent during the first five seasons of the series, in which Kenny would suffer an excruciating death before returning alive and well in the next episode with little or no explanation. Stan would frequently use the catchphrase "Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!", followed by Kyle exclaiming "You bastards!". Since the show began its sixth season in 2002, the practice of killing Kenny has been seldom used by the show's creators, although he did eventually possess Eric Cartman's body for 4 episodes. Various episodes have set up the gag, sometimes presenting a number of explanations for Kenny's unacknowledged reappearances. In the episode "Mysterion Rises," it is found that Kenny actually has the superpower of resurrection, claiming that no matter how many times he's died, he always wakes up in his bed the next day wearing his usual clothes. He also states that none of his peers or family can remember him dying whatsoever. However, in some episodes, the other kids can recall Kenny being killed and mention how he died all the time.</p>

            <p>Kenny is known for his iconic outfit of an orange jacket and brown mittens.</p>
